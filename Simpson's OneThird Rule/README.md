# Base 10 to Binary Converter

This algorithim uses the Simpson's 1/3 rule to evaluate the integral of mutiple data points. If the amount of intervals are even, then the trapezoidal rule is applied to the last interval.

## Inputs:
- A vector of independet values (x)
- A vector of dependent values (y)
## Outputs:
- The calculated integral

## Limitations:
- Dependent values must be equally spaced
- X and Y must ahve the same amount of values
