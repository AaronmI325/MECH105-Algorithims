# LU Factorization

This algorithim determines the LU Factorization of a square matrix with the use of pivoting. Inputting any square matrix will return the same matrix after having gone through LU Facrtorization. Meaning that it will return a lower triangular matrix and an upper triangular matrix along with the pivot matrix used.

## Inputs:
- Any matrix

## Outputs:
- Lower Triangular matrix
- Upper Triangiular matrix
- The Pivot matrix

## Limitations:
- Must be an square matrix (2x2, 3x3, 7x7, etc...)
