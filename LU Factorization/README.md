# LU Factorization

This Algortithim determines the LU Factorization of a square Matrix with the use of pivoting. Inputting any square matrix will return the same matrix after having gone through LU Facrtorization. Meaning that it will return an lower triangular matrix and an upper triangular matrix.

## Inputs:
- Any square matrix

## Outputs:
- Lower Triangular matrix
- Upper Triangiular matrix
- The Pivot matrix

## Limitations:
- Must be an even square matrix (2x2, 3x3, 7x7, etc...)
