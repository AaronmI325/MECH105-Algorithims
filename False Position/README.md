# False Position Method
This Algorithim uses the False position method to estimate the root of any given function. 

## Inputs:
- The function being evaluated
- The lower guess
- The upper guess
- The desired relative error (optional)
- The max ammount of iterations needed (optional)
- Any parameters used by the function (optional)

## Outputs:
 - The estimated root
 - The function evaluated at the root
 - The approximate relative error
 - The total number of iterations used
 
 ## Limitations 
 - Upper and lower guess can't can't be the same sign (Positive or negative)
